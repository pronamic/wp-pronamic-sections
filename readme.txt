== Description ==
Give your site the option for storing tabbed wysiwyg content. _This plugin requires modifying the template files to get the tab content. You can then show however you want_

== Installation ==
Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your 
WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I show the extra content? =

For now, you are required to modify the template files. In the future we are going to update with a shortcode and some prewritten styles to show
your tabs.

To show that content, you need to reference the only function we offer `the_pronamic_sections()`
You can give the function a specific page ID to get all the tabs for that ID, otherwise it will use the global $post ID.

= When I press move tab, nothing happens =

You can only move tabs if there is space. Example. The top tab, can not move top any further.
